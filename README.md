# Schmee

Better notifications systems through SMS command interpretation.  Schmee is an Android app. built with ionic.  We would build for iOS, but until Apple releases some access to reading SMS with their API, we will not be able to improve their notifications.


We aren't open source yet, but we intend to go open source soonish, so if you are interested in developing Schmee, follow the repo.
