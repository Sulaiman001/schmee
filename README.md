# Schmee

Schmee provides better notification and SMS options for Android. Allows trusted senders to set the notification level of their text messages.  Receive !silent, !alert, and !emergency SMS messages from friends and family.

We aren't open source yet, but we intend to go open source soonish, so if you are interested in developing Schmee, follow the repo.
