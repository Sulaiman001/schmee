The way notifications work with SMS messages needs improvement.  It works, but it doesn't work well.  The notification level is controlled entirely on the receiving end.  This is backwards because the actual level of alert for a message is determined by the sender who would know whether it is an emergency situation, something to ring the receiver about, or just a message to be viewed at leisure.  On the receiving end, users should be able to set whether they accept various alert levels from their different contacts and unknown numbers.  Our Android app allows you to receive !silent, !alert, and !sos in SMS messages and be notified accordingly.  

!schedule allows you to set a time for the message to alert the user.  This one is really useful for reminder type text messages.  "Remember to pick up the kids at 3 <3 !schedule 2:30PM".  There is an Emergency Mode in settings that silences all incoming SMS except for !sos messages, which can be very useful for when in meetings or sleeping.  

Ringtones for SMS messages also need improvement.  The ringtone is the first thing anouncing your message, and it's entirely controlled on the receiving end.  You can silence, or change your default ringtone, and set different ringtones for a user, but we think senders should be able to specify the sound to play for their message's notification.  Senders should be able to record or upload custom sounds to send to friends.  People should be able to specify the ringtone to play for their message like this, "Ready to meetup? Danger zone! !howler snd.url".
